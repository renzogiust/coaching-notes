🇬🇧 Today, I’m experimenting.

“I have a dream, an idea, a project — maybe even a change of direction — but I don’t feel ready to bring it to life.  
My heart knows what it wants, my instinct pushes me forward… but my mind blocks everything.  
I don’t feel enough.”

“It feels like a leap into the void.  
I’m scared.  
And it’s okay to be scared, right?”

“What if it doesn’t work out? What a 💩 situation that would be.  
I can’t afford that.”

“But… is it really a leap into the void?  
Maybe I’m just blowing things out of proportion.  
I don’t know — right now, everything just feels confusing.”  
..  
..  
“What am I waiting for?  
What’s holding me back?  
Am I waiting for someone to tell me what to do — or how to do it?  
Waiting for the right cosmic alignment?  
Or something else?”  

“I mean, I am doing something…  
but maybe I’m just circling around it.”

“I see everyone so active — feeds full of people doing things. And me?”

The mind goes into a loop. 🔄  
Like a computer processor, it overloads.  
Freeze. Block.  
..  
..  
  
“How much is this block costing me?  
What am I giving up?”  
..  
..  
“Damn.”  

And as I read these words again, I realize these are familiar roads.  
I’ve walked them before — and, honestly, sometimes I still do.

But I can only feel grateful for coaching, which helped me loosen, unpack, and dissolve many of those blocks.  
One session after another. Work, presence, commitment. The “big leap” turned into a sequence of smaller steps. Doable ones.

A while ago, I would’ve never dared to write something like this.  
Today, I kind of don’t care 🙂 — because I truly believe it’s worth taking the risk of writing something a bit “out of line,”
of being vulnerable, if it resonates even with just one person and inspires them to take a small step toward their own fulfillment.
