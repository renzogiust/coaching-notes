🇬🇧 A few weeks ago I wrote a post about the importance of our role, about how it defines us. It is the outfit we wear every day, and we may like it a lot, or not so much.
If you haven’t read it, you can find it here:

With this post, I invite you now to slow down and take one more step forward.

An invitation that is also, potentially, a big challenge: taking off that outfit.

So… take off the outfit you wear every day.

Done?
Outfit gone. Role gone.

You are no longer an Account Manager, Project Manager, UX UI Designer, Developer, Digital Strategist, Art Director, Tech Lead, CTO, CEO, Analyst, Marketing Manager, etc.

What remains is “just” you: a human being, born without labels or roles, and who will end their journey in the same way.
Do not think about others right now. Stay “on your own” and try to look at yourself.
It might not be easy, but try to stay with this invitation.

What emerges now, when the role is no longer there?
Where does this feeling settle in your body?

There is nothing to fix here. Only something to listen to.

Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone! 🎄
