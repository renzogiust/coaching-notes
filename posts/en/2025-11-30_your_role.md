🇬🇧 **Your role**  
When the moment comes to introduce yourself, you usually start there: name and role or title. Then you continue: I develop this, I design that, I sell something else.
It’s a habit, the way we’ve learned to talk about ourselves.  
If you think about it, you spend a large part of your life with a label attached to you: your role.

The role matters.  
It represents you, it is the outfit you wear every day, the outfit others see and the one you see when you look in the mirror.

When you look at yourself in this outfit, what is the first emotion that comes up?

How does it feel on your skin?  
Does it give you space or does it force you into a shape that doesn’t feel like yours?

What does it express about you and what does it hide?  
What is your relationship with this outfit, today?

If you could modify it, even just a little, what would you change?  
And if you could imagine a new one, what would it be like?
