🇬🇧  The Wheel of Life is a simple yet highly effective tool to check in on balance, priorities, and personal satisfaction.
It is often used in coaching to quickly visualize how we are distributing energy and attention across different areas of life: work, health, relationships, growth, and time for oneself. It offers an immediate snapshot that shows where things are flowing and where something is asking for attention.

After more than 25 years working in the digital world, I realized how much, especially in recent years, the very cognitive way of working in complex digital environments can deeply shift our balance. Digital work is not just a context. It is a place where our mind lives for many hours, with a direct impact on focus, body, emotions, and relationships.  
This is why I decided to experiment and create a more specific reading.

This led to the Wheel of Digital Work Life in its MVP version: a wheel designed to observe how you are navigating cognitive load, ability to maintain deep focus, body awareness, quality of professional connections, sense of impact, emotional stability, and offline spaces. A quick tool, with the ambition to spark awareness.  

If you want to try it, you can take the test here:

At the end (from desktop) you can save the image of your wheel.
And if you want to share what emerged by looking at the final chart, it might become a useful conversation for others too.
