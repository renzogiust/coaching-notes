Debugging yourself is harder than debugging code.

Usually, when there’s a problem with code, we follow a method:
- we try to reproduce the bug
- we add logs
- we set a breakpoint
- we observe what happens  
Or, if we’re stuck, we ask the AI. :)

Either way, a method exists.

But what happens when we are the code?

When we find ourselves in situations where a decision has to be made, we feel a bit off-center, maybe stuck, while next to us a digital world keeps moving fast and is always on.  
That’s when the method sometimes disappears.

We keep going anyway, sometimes covering our eyes, ears, mouth, nose, depending on the case, increasing and prolonging the effort.

What’s missing in those moments is a system to debug ourselves.  
This is the kind of work I do: I create a structured and safe space, a “breakpoint” for conversation and reflection, that allows you to see your logs more clearly and brings up perspectives that were not accessible before.

If, while reading this, you recognize yourself in at least one of these situations and you’re curious to see what happens when you try coaching as a debugging tool, ping me.


PS. Speaking of AI: in recent years we’ve started using generative systems, powerful systems capable of producing incredible outputs, but only if the prompt is high quality.  
With coaching, something similar happens. A coaching session is a generative space where, together, we build effective and precise prompts, generating new perspectives and awareness that you can carry into your day-to-day work in a very concrete way.

But this metaphor deserves a post of its own.
