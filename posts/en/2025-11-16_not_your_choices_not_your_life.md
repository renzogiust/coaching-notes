A few days ago my neurons came up with a rather unusual association: two worlds that seem incredibly distant at first glance, Bitcoin and coaching.

“Not your keys, not your coins.”  
This saying is well-known in the Bitcoin world. If you don’t hold the private keys, those Bitcoins aren’t truly yours: you’re simply using an account controlled by someone else. It’s the core principle of self-custody: without the keys, there is no real ownership or freedom over your money.

Bringing this metaphor into everyday life, another sentence came to mind: “Not your choices, not your life.”

When someone else ends up choosing on our behalf, we eventually live a life that isn’t really ours. Not because we lack the ability to decide, but because, often without realizing it, we hand over the custody of our decisions.

And it’s not about controlling every detail. It’s about reclaiming what has always belonged to us: the right to choose, to change direction, to adjust our path, to realign.
And yes, it takes courage to take responsibility for our own choices. Delegating is easier, but it’s also how we end up inhabiting a life that no longer feels like our own.

Coaching proves effective precisely because it creates the space to observe one’s choices, recognize what limits them, bring to light what truly matters, and take responsibility for what one wants to move forward. Through targeted questions, guided reflections, and a non-judgmental dialogue, it helps reconnect with one’s inner compass and regain the ability to choose consciously.
In this sense, it symbolically hands back the keys to one’s own decisions.
Not to build a perfect life, but an authentic one, aligned with who we truly are.
